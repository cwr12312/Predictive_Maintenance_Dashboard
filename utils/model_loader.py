"""
utils/model_loader.py
======================
Loads the six trained models (three .keras, three .pth) exactly as saved.
Handles deserialization of models saved with newer TensorFlow versions.

Why this file is more defensive than a typical model-loading module:
the three Keras models were trained/saved with a TensorFlow version that
may not exactly match the one installed at deploy time, so a plain
`tf.keras.models.load_model(...)` call can fail on config fields the
installed TF doesn't recognise (e.g. `DTypePolicy`, `quantization_config`).
`load_keras_model_compatible()` below works around this by trying several
progressively more permissive loading strategies before giving up, and
`recreate_model_from_name()` is the last resort: rebuild the architecture
from scratch and load just the weights.

The .pth (PyTorch) models don't have this version-skew problem since the
checkpoint stores the architecture hyperparameters (`arch`/`model_config`)
alongside the weights, so `load_torch_checkpoint()` can just rebuild the
exact architecture and call `load_state_dict()`.

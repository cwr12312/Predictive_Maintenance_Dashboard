utils/preprocessing.py
=======================
Reproduces the feature-engineering pipeline described in the Interim Report
and used by every training script (fbcl_model.py, maml.py, transfomer.py,
lstm_model.py, 2d_cnn.py):

    9 base statistical features  ->  + 10 engineered ratio/interaction terms
    ->  19-dimensional feature vector  ->  StandardScaler  ->  model input

Because the raw scaler objects (`scaler.pkl` fitted during training) were
not part of the uploaded bundle, this module fits a *reference* scaler at
app start-up from representative synthetic statistics consistent with the
dataset documentation (Table 2 / Table 4, Interim Report: CWRU, 10 balanced
classes, mean-zero / unit-variance engineered space). If the user supplies
their own `feature_scaler.pkl` / `label_encoder.pkl` in `data/`, those are
used automatically instead — see `load_reference_scaler()`.
